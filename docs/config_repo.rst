The config repository
=====================

Many parameters are available to the users through the config repository.
The config repository is a special projects to configure many Software Factory services.
This enables users to propose modifications through the code review system,
and after change approval, the config-update job applies configuration change.

To update the configuration repo:

* First clone the repository: git clone http://<fqdn>/r/config
* Edit files and commit: git commit
* Create a review: git review
* Approve the review to run config update

.. note::

  Files starting by a "_" are default settings and they may be modified by
  an upgrade of Software Factory, thus they **shouldn't be modified manually**.
