features:
  - Nodepool service support for diskimage builder based
    slave image.
upgrade:
  - The nodepool configuration now uses os-client-config
    and provides the full 'providers', 'labels' and
    'diskimages' configuration through the config-repo.
    The images.yaml and labels.yaml are merged into a single
    nodepool.yaml that better reflect openstack-infra project-config.
  - Nodepool provider tuning such as max-server are now exposed
    through the config repo.
