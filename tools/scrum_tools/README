SCRUM TOOLS
===========

This script allows scrum masters to manage easily tasks on Storyboard.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Using the tag "groomed" to mark stories that were validated by the team
* Using the tag "bug" to differentiate stories and bug reports
* Using the tag "confirmed" to mark bug reports that are reproducible
* An automated worklist for unrefined stories: "Stories where ProjectGroup is XXX and Tags is not groomed and Tags is not bug and StoryStatus is Active"
* An automated worklist for for bug triage: "Stories where ProjectGroup is XXX and Tags is bug and Tags is not confirmed and StoryStatus is Active"

The sprint board will consist of the following lanes:

* Groomed Stories: stories that were approved and prepared by the team -> tagged "groomed", not "blocked", not "bug", at least one task still open
* Blocked: tasks (any type) marked with the "blocked" tag
* Open Tasks: tasks from groomed stories (not bugs) that aren't assigned yet, not "blocked"
* Open, Confirmed Bugs: tasks from triaged bug stories that aren't assigned yet (stories marked "bug" and "confirmed"), not "blocked"
* Current Sprint: tasks from groomed stories or triaged bug stories that are assigned, not "blocked"
* In Progress: tasks in status "In progress", not "blocked"
* Ready for Review: tasks in status "review", not "blocked"
* Done: tasks set in status "Done" during the sprint

Workflow
--------

AT ANY TIME DURING THE SPRINT (OR DURING GROOMING)
..................................................

1. Someone writes a story (eventually with sub tasks), no specific tag set
2. The team checks the "to groom" worklist
    - is it a story ? Groom it if valid, add tag "groomed" when groomed to satisfaction
    - is it a bug ? Triage it if valid, groom it more eventually
3. If a task cannot be worked on because of a temporary blocker, tag it as "blocked"

When the grooming is over, run::

  python sf_scrummaster.py --url https://softwarefactory-project.io --api-key YOURAPIKEY --project-group Software-Factory --board sf-backlog-ng boards update

To rearrange tasks in the board automatically.

AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW SPRINT
................................

1. The team discusses blocked tasks: did the impediment disappear? What can be done to resume  work ?
    -> if unblocked: remove tag
    -> else: add more tasks to parent story to resolve blocker if possible
2. The team discusses tasks still in "Review" or "Progress" lanes. These are our "stock" and should always
   be kept at a minimal level.
3. The tasks from the previous sprint still in "Current Sprint" (assigned but not worked on)
   get discussed by the team. If they are still valid, they remain there, otherwise they get
   unassigned or deemed Invalid
4. The team discusses tasks and bugs to pick from columns "Open Tasks" and "Confirmed, Open Bugs". Picked tasks get assigned to someone who will be the "owner" of the task
    -> the owner is responsible to ensure the task's status is up to date, so usually (but not necessarily) the person who will work on it

-> IMPORTANT !! Finished tasks within the sprint must be set to "Done" before the sprint ends ! 
When the planning is over, run::

  python sf_scrummaster.py --url https://softwarefactory-project.io --api-key YOURAPIKEY --project-group Software-Factory --board sf-backlog-ng sprint start 2017-16

(replace with the name of the sprint, which must be of the form YYYY-WW)

This will empty the "Done" lane and create a new due date on the board.

AT SPRINT END (REVIEW)
......................

1. Before review, task owners make sure tasks are in the correct state (in progress, in review, done, blocked)
2. Review as usual

When the review is over, run::

  python sf_scrummaster.py --url https://softwarefactory-project.io --api-key YOURAPIKEY --project-group Software-Factory --board sf-backlog-ng sprint close 2017-14

To close the sprint. This will tag all the current tasks with the tag "2017-14" for later retrieval and stats.
